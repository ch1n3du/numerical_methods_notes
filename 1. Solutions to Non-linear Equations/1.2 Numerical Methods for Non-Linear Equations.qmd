Numerical methods for solving non-linear equations can be broadly divided into two:

1. Bracketing Methods
2. Open Methods

## Bracketing Methods

These methods take an interval $[a,b]$ which is known to contain
a root of the equation, the interval is reduced through multiple iterations with the aim of increasing the accuracy of the estimate of the root.

## Open Methods

These methods don't require an interval, they just take a rough estimate of the equation's root and iteratively improve the accuracy.
