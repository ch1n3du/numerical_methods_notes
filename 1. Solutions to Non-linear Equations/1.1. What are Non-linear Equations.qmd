Root-finding problems are problems where you are given a continuous function, $f(x)$
and have to find values $r$ where: $f(r) = 0$

## Example 1

Formulate finding the cube root of $2$ as a *root-finding problem*

### Solution

1. Get the equation that expresses the relation:

    $x^3 = 2$

2. Factor the equation to make one side equal to $0$:

    $x^{3} - 2 = 0$

3. Now that the equation is equal to $0$ convert it to a function $f(x)$:

    $f(x) = x^{3} - 2$

4. Find a value $r$ such that $f(r) = 0$

VÃ³ila, you now have a continuous function $f(x)$ that express the relation you want and by finding $r$ you solve your problem.

Numerical Methods are primarily concerned with step $4$, hence the name *root-finding problems*.
